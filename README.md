## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Nuxt.js, Vue.js
- **Backend**: Server API routes with H3
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication
- **Database**: Prisma ORM with relational database
- **AI**: Google Generative AI (Gemini models)
- **Vector Database**: Qdrant for semantic search capabilities
- **Web Search**: Tavily API for retrieving up-to-date information

## System Architecture

LEAF employs a sophisticated multi-step processing pipeline:

1. **Query Analysis**: Determines if a query is climate-related or conversational
2. **Query Routing**: Routes to appropriate processing strategy based on query type
3. **Research Collection**: For research queries, gathers information from:
   - Web search results (prioritizing recent and reliable sources)
   - Vector database of climate knowledge
   - Uploaded PDF documents (when provided)
4. **Response Generation**: Synthesizes information into comprehensive, conversational responses
5. **Source Citation**: Automatically formats and includes references to information sources
